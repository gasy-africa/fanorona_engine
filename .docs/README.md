### :two: Coroutine

> generate coroutine example using rust without concurrency

In this example, we define a Coroutine structure that represents our coroutine. It has a state field to keep track of its progress. The resume method is responsible for executing different steps of the coroutine and printing messages accordingly.

In the main function, we create an instance of Coroutine. We then call the resume method twice to progress through the different states of the coroutine.

When you run this code, it will print the following output:

- [ ] [:point_right: Click to view the output when executing the source code :chart: ](2/OUTPUT.md)

This example demonstrates how to implement a simple coroutine-like behavior without using concurrency. It showcases how the resume method can be called multiple times to progress the coroutine through different states.
